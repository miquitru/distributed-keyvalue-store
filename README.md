Fault-Tolerant Distributed Key-Value Store: The objective of this project was to implement a fault-tolerant key-value 
store on a distributed system environment (Cloud environemnt). It was built using the membership protocol implemented in my previous project 
and supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Stabilization protocol is run after failure
and data replicas( up to three) are recreated after any node failue is detected. 
It was implemented over an emulated cluster network API to run locally, but tested over a real cluster for final grade, where it passed 100% of tests. 
written in C/C++. It was part of Cloud Computing certification course taught by Illinois univeristy in Coursera.
